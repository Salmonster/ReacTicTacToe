# ReacTicTacToe

Tic-Tac-Toe built using ReactJS. The rendering on the front end and the algorithm on the back end that checks for a winner are both equipped to handle any NxN board. The board size can be manipulated by adding to or taking away from the number of n's in the "spaces" array defined in the getInitialState function for the Tictactoe component (found in client/tictactoe.jsx). To run it just clone the repo, npm install from the root directory, then run npm start. Runs on port 8000.
